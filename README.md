# Pymaceutical Exercise

**Overview:**

In this challenge, I learned how to combine and clean data using pandas dataframes. Along with utilizing matplot and pandas plots to create scatter and bar plots.

<ins> Takeaway </ins> 

I learned two new methods of performing data synthesis within dataframes. Using duplicated, I was able to filter data using two columns/ criterias. Moreover, using an aggregated method, I was able to more easily create summary statisitcs within a dataframe.

<ins> Analysis Conclusion: </ins> 

* Across the total treatment groups, Ramicane outperforms Capomulin in treatment as the average Tumor Volume in measurement of the mean and median is lower, along with the standard deviation.
* Capomulin is the second best treatment indicated by the second best boxplot statistics (lower, upper bounds and quartiles).
* Tumor volume looks to be postively correlatd to the size of the mouse weight (R value of .84). One can assume that treatment amount would also increase with the increase in size of a mouse.
